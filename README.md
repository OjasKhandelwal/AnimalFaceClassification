# AnimalFaceClassification

AnimalFaceClassification is a deep learning project implemented in PyTorch for classifying images of animal faces. The project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically learn and recognize features from input images. It includes steps for data preprocessing, building and training a CNN model, and evaluating its performance on animal face datasets.
